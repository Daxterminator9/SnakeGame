        Welcome to The Leviathan Chronicles, a simple rendition of the much beloved classic Snake game. You are a mighty
        leviathan snake and thankfully (for other creatures), you are a vegetarian. You love apples and want to eat as
        many as you can to satisfy your hunger and stay alive. Unfortunately, you can only grow so big before becoming
        too big for the world to handle you. Your goal is simple, just eat as much as you can, stay as long as you can,
        and score as much as you can. Remember, your score increases as you grow in size. Enjoy and have fun :)
